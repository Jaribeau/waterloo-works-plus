# Waterloo Works Plus
A little script to patch some of the UI atrocities that exist in WaterlooWorks.

I whipped this together to deal with some of the biggest, lowest hanging frustrations. 
This is my last co-op search, so if you're interested in maintaining this longer term, turning it into a Chrome extension, etc fire me a message.

## Features
 * Makes the job search results view great (again?)
 * Hides the big side bar
 * Resizes table elements so you don't have to side-scroll
 * Makes the 'add' and 'remove' from shortlist buttons the same size
 * Adds a dash of colour here and there

## Installation

### Google Chrome
 * Install the [TamperMonkey extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) from the Chrome Web Store
 * Install the Waterloo Works Plus script from [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/26665-waterlooworks-plus)
 * Best served with a slice of lime.
 
### FireFox
 * Disclaimer: I haven't actually tested this yet, but it should work:
 * Install [GreaseMoney extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) from Mozilla Add-ons
 * Install the Waterloo Works Plus script from [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/26665-waterlooworks-plus)
 * Best served with a slice of lemon.
